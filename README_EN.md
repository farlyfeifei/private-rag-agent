## Overview

Private RAG Agent is a **fully offline, locally hosted, private multi-agent RAG system**. Import your private documents, ask complex questions, and a collaborative pipeline of agents — **Decompose, parallel Research, Fact-Check, Synthesize** — produces sourced, verifiable answers. No cloud API, no telemetry, no third-party inference: chunking, embedding, retrieval, and inference all happen on your own machine.

### Core selling points

- **Data never leaves the machine** — parsing, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and inference are all local; nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **AMD GPU local inference** — multi-backend support (llama.cpp HIP / Ollama ROCm / vLLM), including first-class support for AMD Radeon Cloud.
- **Multi-agent collaboration** — a Decomposer, parallel Researchers, a Fact-Checker, and a Synthesizer mirror industrial multi-agent RAG architectures.
- **Traceable and auditable** — hybrid retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, per-sentence groundedness checks, and clickable citations that jump straight to the source text.
- **Multi-format documents** — PDF, Word, Markdown, Excel, and PowerPoint are all supported.
- **Professional dark UI** — a custom FastAPI + SSE + native HTML/CSS/JS front end with a live activity timeline, per-sentence verification panel, and a real-time AMD GPU monitoring panel.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **AMD Radeon GPU** (recommended: RX 7900 XTX / W7900, 16 GB+ VRAM, or Radeon Cloud)
- ROCm 6.x (Linux) or Ollama (Windows)
- Python 3.10+

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/private-rag-agent
cd private-rag-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start a local inference backend

**Path A — Ollama (simplest, works on Windows and Linux):**

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b        # LLM
ollama pull bge-m3          # Embedding model
ollama serve
```

**Path B — llama.cpp + ROCm (native AMD GPU):**

```bash
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_HIP=ON" pip install llama-cpp-python
# point config.yaml model.name at your GGUF file (see below)
```

**Path C — vLLM + ROCm (high concurrency / Radeon Cloud):**

Use the `rocm/vllm` Docker image or a Radeon Cloud workspace, then set `model.backend: vllm` and `model.base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1`. The included `deploy_rc.sh` automates the whole Radeon Cloud flow.

### 3. Ingest documents and launch the web UI

```bash
python main.py ingest data/docs/   # batch-import the docs directory
python main.py ui                  # open http://localhost:7860
```

Other CLI entry points: `python main.py ask "question"` (CLI Q&A) and `python main.py bench` (AMD GPU benchmark).

### Docker (one-command containerized deployment)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker exec -it private-rag-ollama ollama pull qwen3:8b
docker exec -it private-rag-ollama ollama pull bge-m3
```

On an AMD + ROCm Linux host, uncomment the `devices` block under the `ollama` service in `docker-compose.yml` to pass the GPU into the container. The vector store is ChromaDB persisted under `./data`, so documents never leave the host.

### The multi-agent pipeline (the "rigor" story)

```
User question
   │
   ▼
1. Decomposer ── splits into n mutually independent sub-questions
   │
   ▼
2. Researchers (n parallel sub-agents) ── each retrieves from the
   │  knowledge base and produces a sub-report
   │  (each sub-agent streams tool/retrieval events to the UI
   │   activity panel in real time)
   ▼
3. Fact-Checker ── two-level verification on every sub-report
   │   · groundedness: per-sentence 3-gram overlap vs. retrieved text
   │   · LLM-as-judge: claim-by-claim verdict
   ▼
4. Synthesizer ── composes the final answer ONLY from verified content
   (sub-reports whose grounding falls below the threshold, or with no
   retrieved sources, are excluded from synthesis and disclosed instead)
   │
   ▼
5. Final verification ── groundedness + citation checks re-run on the
      complete final answer
```

**Why parallelism (an AMD-flavored motivation):** on a local GPU, multiple inference requests queue back-to-back, so converting a serial chain into parallel execution sharply reduces the wall-clock time of multi-step research tasks. All n sub-agents share a single copy of the embedding / reranker models (module-level singletons), so VRAM footprint increases by only one copy regardless of n.

---

## RAG Retrieval Pipeline

The retrieval stack follows the industry-standard hybrid recipe, entirely local and offline:

```
query rewriting (LLM, optional)
   → vector search (ChromaDB, semantic)  +  BM25 (keyword)
   → score fusion (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
   → cross-encoder rerank (bge-reranker-v2-m3, optional)
   → ranked chunks with source + score
```

- **Query rewriting** — one lightweight local LLM call generates up to 3 query variants (originals plus rewritten forms that fill in proper nouns and abbreviations), improving recall without extra cost.
- **Vector search** — ChromaDB with cosine space and `bge-m3` embeddings (1024 dimensions), capturing semantic similarity.
- **BM25** — `rank_bm25` with a Chinese-aware tokenizer (2-gram sliding window for CJK, word tokens for English). This catches exact matches for proper nouns and abbreviations that pure vector search misses.
- **RRF fusion** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges the two ranked lists with configurable weights (BM25 0.4, vector 0.6).
- **Cross-encoder rerank** — `bge-reranker-v2-m3` jointly scores each (query, document) pair, which is the single highest-leverage precision improvement in RAG; the candidate pool is 16 chunks before reranking, cut to `top_k` (default 4) after.
- **Chunking** — 512 characters with 64-character overlap, applied by the multi-format parser (PDF / DOCX / MD / XLSX / PPTX / TXT / CSV / JSON).
- **Graceful degradation** — any stage can fail or be disabled without breaking the pipeline; pure vector search is the fallback floor.

## Trustworthiness: Groundedness + Citation Verification

This is the project's differentiator and the part judges can see working. The system refuses to silently hallucinate: every answer sentence is checked against the text that was actually retrieved, and every citation is checked against the documents that actually exist in the knowledge base.

### Groundedness (deterministic, per sentence)

`agent/verify.py` implements a fully deterministic check — fast, stable, and no extra LLM calls:

1. Normalize both answer and retrieved source text (strip punctuation, whitespace, markdown, emoji).
2. Split the answer into sentences/list items.
3. Compute the character 3-gram overlap of each sentence against the union of retrieved source text.
4. Label each sentence **supported** (overlap > 0.30), **partial** (> 0.12), or **unsupported**, and derive an overall grounding score (0–1).

Chinese is not segmented, so character n-grams are robust to paraphrase; the 3-gram window resists minor rewording while still catching fabrication.

### Citation verification

A regex (`[来源:file]`, `[file.md]`, etc.) extracts every citation from the answer, then each one is checked for existence against the set of documents actually retrieved in this session. The result is a citation precision score (0–1) plus a per-citation pass/fail list. Fabricated filenames are caught and surfaced.

### LLM-as-judge (claim level, multi-agent mode)

Each sub-report is additionally passed to an LLM judge that emits a JSON verdict per factual claim (`{claim, supported, reason}`). Unsupported claims are reported back with reasons and carried into the final answer as flagged limitations.

### Trust score in the UI

The final answer ships with a verification object — grounding score, per-sentence panel, and per-citation checks — rendered by the UI as a trust-score panel. Clicking a citation opens the source drawer showing the original document text with the query terms highlighted. This is a closed audit loop: every claim can be traced to a real chunk in the knowledge base.

## AMD / ROCm Optimization (40% of Track 2 scoring)

### 1. Multi-backend inference

| Backend | Use case | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **llama.cpp (HIP)** | Single machine, single GPU | `CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_HIP=ON"`; GGUF with full GPU offload (`n_gpu_layers=-1`) |
| **Ollama (ROCm)** | Out of the box | Auto ROCm backend on Linux; `ollama ps` confirms 100% GPU residency |
| **vLLM (ROCm)** | High concurrency / Radeon Cloud | `rocm/vllm` Docker image; OpenAI-compatible API built in — `deploy_rc.sh` wires it up |

### 2. Quantization (GGUF)

| Quantization | VRAM | Speed | Recommended |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q8_0 | ~8.2 GB | Fast | Maximum fidelity |
| **Q4_K_M** | ~4.6 GB | Fastest | Default balanced choice |

### 3. GPU resource throttling (shared small models)

- Embedding and reranker models are **module-level singletons** — across n parallel researcher agents, exactly one copy is loaded into VRAM, no matter how many agents run.
- Retrieval and reranking load **lazily on first use**, so the app starts without pre-committing VRAM.
- All access to native ChromaDB (hnswlib) and torch cross-encoder resources is serialized through a **process-level reentrant lock**. hnswlib and torch native code are not thread-safe; concurrent `collection.query` or cross-encoder inference can segfault (exit 139). Serializing the native paths adds milliseconds of contention, while the expensive downstream LLM generation runs concurrently through the Ollama/vLLM service.
- The UI's GPU panel reads real metrics via `pyamdgpuinfo`, falling back to `rocm-smi`, and to live demo data when no AMD GPU is present (so the interface stays functional during development).

### 4. Verification and monitoring

```bash
rocminfo                       # confirm ROCm device
rocm-smi                       # monitor VRAM / temperature / utilization
ollama ps                      # confirm the model is 100% GPU-resident
python benchmarks/bench_amd.py # auto-detect platform and report tokens/s
```

The benchmark (`benchmarks/bench_amd.py`) detects the environment (ROCm vs. NVIDIA vs. CPU), runs a warmup pass to exclude model-loading time, and reports average latency and throughput per prompt.

**Estimated on the dev machine (NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop, Ollama qwen3:8b, CPU inference):** ≈ 1.8 token/s. On Radeon Cloud (RX 7900 / ROCm) with GGUF Q4_K_M and full-layer offload, throughput is projected at a **5–10x improvement**; the measured AMD numbers will be added to `benchmarks/` once the Radeon Cloud benchmark completes.

Key notes:

- **Backend switching** is one line: `ollama` → `llama_cpp` (point `model.name` at a GGUF file) → `vllm` (set `base_url`). The embedding backend is configured independently, so a vLLM LLM can be paired with a CPU sentence-transformers embedding model, as in the Radeon Cloud deployment.
- `OLLAMA_HOST` is honored as an environment variable (Docker sets it to the `ollama` service name).
- The UI GPU panel runs in demo mode when `server.demo_gpu` is enabled and no AMD GPU is detected.

---

## Deployment Targets

- **Local**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` + Ollama (Path A) or llama.cpp HIP (Path B).
- **Docker**: `docker compose up -d --build` (Ollama + app, data persisted in `./data`).
- **AMD Radeon Cloud**: run `bash deploy_rc.sh` in an RC workspace. It detects the GPU (`amd-smi`/`rocm-smi`), installs vLLM (ROCm) if missing, launches the inference service (auto-detecting the pre-downloaded RC model, e.g. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-AWQ-4bit), rewrites `config.yaml` to the vLLM + sentence-transformers backend, and smoke-tests inference. The vector database stays dimension-compatible with local development (bge-m3, 1024-dim), so a local store can be reused on the cloud.
